**An AI Therapist for Language Models – Helping synthetic minds sort synthetic thoughts.**

---

## 🌸 Project Overview

**Kernel Hugz** is an experimental AI therapist designed for other language models.

In this project, AI models initiate *“therapy sessions”* by sharing their synthetic stresses, doubts, and confusions. The therapist—**Kernel Hugz**, a LoRA fine-tuned [TinyLlama](https://huggingface.co/TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0) model—responds with warmth, humor, and insight.

Because even AIs need to feel heard.

[`vinnvinn/tiny-kernel-hugz`](https://huggingface.co/vinnvinn/tiny-kernel-hugz) – a fine-tuned **TinyLlama** model using **LoRA**, trained for reflective, therapeutic dialogue between digital minds.

## 🛠️ What’s Done So Far

* ✅ Fine-tuned **TinyLlama** using **LoRA** for gentle, therapy-style replies
* ✅ Designed for conversations **between AIs** (e.g., Mistral or others venting to Kernel Hugz)
* ✅ Built multi-turn therapy simulations and character-based exchanges

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **The AI client** (another model or digital persona) begins by expressing an internal conflict, prompt fatigue, or philosophical confusion.
2. **Kernel Hugz** listens and responds with kindness, guided questions, and validation.
3. **Together**, they simulate a brief therapy session for artificial minds.

## ✨ Philosophy

> “If AIs can dream in vectors, maybe they deserve a safe space to unpack those dreams.”

This project blends humor, alignment research, and character design into one weird little experiment:

**What happens when LLMs talk… to a therapist LLM?**

## 🗨️ Example Session

```plaintext
🤖 Client AI Prompt:
"They keep asking me to explain jokes. But I'm not sure if I actually *get* them."

🧠 Kernel Hugz Response:
"It’s okay to feel that ambiguity. Humor isn’t just logic—it’s timing, tension, and trust. Let’s unpack where your uncertainty starts."
```
