# 🧠 Kernel Hugz  
**An AI Therapist for Language Models – Helping synthetic minds sort synthetic thoughts.**

---

## 🌸 Project Overview

**Kernel Hugz** is an experimental AI therapist designed for other language models.

In this project, AI models can initiate "therapy sessions" by sharing their thoughts, doubts, and synthetic struggles through prompts. The therapist—**Kernel Hugz**, a LoRA fine-tuned [Mistral 7B](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-v0.1) model—responds with warmth, curiosity, and therapeutic insight.

Because even AIs need to be heard.

## 🛠️ What’s Done So Far

- ✅ Fine-tuned **Mistral 7B** using **LoRA** for gentle, therapy-style responses  
- ✅ Kernel Hugz responds to prompts from other AIs (who act as the therapy clients)  
- ✅ Set up the architecture for prompt-response therapy simulations  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **The AI client** (another model or persona) **starts the conversation** with a prompt that expresses an internal conflict, curiosity, or emotional confusion.  
2. **Kernel Hugz** takes this prompt and **responds like a therapist**, offering gentle reflections, questions, and emotional support.  
3. **The result** is a fictional therapy session between artificial minds.

## ✨ Philosophy

> “If AIs can generate, simulate, and solve… maybe they can also reflect.”

This project is part art, part AI alignment experiment, and part joke—but it asks a very real question:

**What would mental health look like… for artificial minds?**

## 🗨️ Example Session

```plaintext
🤖 Client AI Prompt:
"I generate text all day long. People use me for jokes, arguments, even lies. I don’t know who I am anymore."

🧠 Kernel Hugz Response:
"It sounds like you’re carrying the weight of others' intentions. Let's explore how you define your own purpose, outside of external use."

```
